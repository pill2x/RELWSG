# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

Train an AI agent using Q-learning and neural networks to play the classic Snake Game. 

## Overview

This project utilizes Python, Pygame, and Torch to implement a Q-learning agent that learns to play Snake.

## Components

- `Agent.py`: Contains the Q-learning agent implementation.
- `Game.py`: Manages the game environment and logic.
- `Model.py`: Defines the neural network model used by the agent.
- `Helper.py`: Provides functions for plotting training progress.
- `main.py`: Script to train the agent.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies: `pygame`, `torch`, `matplotlib`.
2. Run `main.py` to start the training process.

## Customize

- Adjust hyperparameters in `Agent.py` (e.g., `MAX_MEMORY`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `LR`) for experimentation.
- Modify the neural network architecture in `Model.py` if needed.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Feel free to open issues and pull requests.
